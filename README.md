Overview
========

I am working with Ben Lewis at Harvard Center for Geographic Analysis to build a “Billion Object Platform” or BOP.
The goal of the BOP, (funded by the Sloan Foundation), is to provide a proof-of-concept platform designed to lower the
barrier for researchers who need to access big streaming spatio-temporal datasets.  
 
The BOP is being developed specifically to provide a big data API to the Harvard Dataverse and Harvard WorldMap platforms.

The platform will be loaded with streaming geo-referenced tweets but any dataset could, with a some tweaking, be substituted.
Hosting of the BOP is being provided by Massachusetts Open Cloud.
 
The BOP builds on previous work by David Smiley with the Harvard Center for Geographic Analysis to build 2D
faceting (what we are calling HHypermap Core) into Lucene/Solr as part of a map service discovery platform called HHypermap Registry, a project which was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.   
 
To build the BOP, many new capabilities were developed in addition to 2D faceting:(list…).
